//Constraint that makes sure that your database will never contain more than one node with a specific label and one property value
//create UNIQUE

CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (node:label) ASSERT node.key IS UNIQUE

for example:-
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (book:Book) ASSERT book.isbn IS UNIQUE

CREATE (book:Book { isbn: '1449356265', title: 'Graph Databases' })          //created
CREATE (book:Book { isbn: '1449356265', title: 'Graph Databases' })          //second node not created because isbn must be unique

//drop UNIQUE

DROP CONSTRAINT ON (book:Book) ASSERT book.isbn IS UNIQUE


//To create a constraint that makes sure that all nodes with a certain label have a certain property mandatory
//create exists

CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (book:Book) ASSERT exists(book.isbn)

CREATE (book:Book { isbn: '1449356265', title: 'Graph Databases' })        //created
CREATE (book:Book { title: 'Graph Databases' })                            //not created because isbn key is not present

//drop exists

DROP CONSTRAINT ON (book:Book) ASSERT exists(book.isbn)

//removal of mandatory key not possible

MATCH (book:Book { title: 'Graph Databases' })
REMOVE book.isbn                                                          //the property is not removed.


//NODE KEYS : ensure properties are present and unique

CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (n:Person) ASSERT (n.firstname, n.surname) IS NODE KEY
